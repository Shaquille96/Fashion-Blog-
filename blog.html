  <p>If you&#39;re lucky or connected you can get an invite, sans the price tag. But I wasn&#39;t so lucky or connected my first 2 years so I&#39;m here to help you out. First, plan out which shows are most important to you and make a schedule and this is a biggie: SET A BUDGET. If you&#39;re worrying about blowing your cash the whole time you won&#39;t have fun. Then check out prices, days, and times and prioritize the designers you want to see most. Lastly, purchase your tickets and get excited&#33;</p>
  <h2>Getting Tickets &amp; Picking the Show</h2>
  <h2>Dressing for the Shows</h2>

  <p>Always be true to your own sense of style, if you dont you&#39;ll be uncomfortable the whole time and it will show. Remember, NYFW is about expressing yourself and taking in what the designers have chosen to express through their new lines. Also it&#39;s important to wear shoes you&#39;ll be comfortable in all day. Obviously you want to look good, but youâ€™ll be on your feet all day long, so be prepared.</p>
